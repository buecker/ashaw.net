                        AShaw was founded by Antonio D. Shaw. I have decided to launch this company based on a belief in myself and my ability to assist others in helping them become better versions of themselves. I came to the realization I had a lot more to offer in the world and decided to do that based on my passion to interact with others and help them see things from a perspective they may not normally have. If you desire to go to another level contact AShaw.<br></p>

                    <strong>Antonio's Insights</strong></h3>
                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">My story started in a way that you probably haven't seen often. Since high school, I repeated two phrases, "If you knew better you would do better" and "If you don't believe in yourself no one else will." These two phrases have been constants in my life and essential building blocks for everything I have and have not accomplished. In order to build your business, self, or brand you have to believe you can and know how to do it.<br><br>
<div>
</div><div>Whatever it is you do that provides purpose to your life I'm sure you believe that you are the best or at least top ten in what you do. If you don't then you should reconsider where you are. Believing this is where you are is a building block to your foundation. Why can't you do more in your current situation? Why can't you get a bigger role which in turn would lead to more income?
</div><div>Have you ever approached your superiors and asked them why something is the way it is or how something works? Do you try to understand the situation you are in so you can apply your knowledge when the time arises? If you aren't doing these things then you aren't maximizing your current potential and providing opportunity for growth.
</div><div><br></div><div>This logic is no different amongst politicians, athletes or any other profession. Just like you, these people understand they are a brand and need to be as marketable as possible in their arena.
</div><div><br></div><div>Don't think because you aren't making a million dollars per year the same logic doesn't apply to you.
</div><div><br></div><div>Have I stimulated your mind? I hope so as I will continue to challenge you to think differently and encourage you to let <strong>AShaw</strong> help you reach your full potential.</div><br><div>12/11/2022</div><br><div><span style="font-size: 2rem;">What did you last week to enhance your brand? Did you have a chat with your superior and ask them about the company and how the year has went? Did you ask your employees what you can do in the new year to acknowledge them better? Maybe you purchased a new ad for your company or self to help promote what you are trying to accomplish. Whatever it is you made an investment in you and it matters that you are always working on getting better. If you didn't do any of these maybe you want to apply this week so next week you are able to answer these questions.</span></div><br><div><span style="font-size: 2rem;">What is your USP (Unique Selling Point)? What makes you so valuable in whatever it is that you do? Instead of creeping out of your lane why not just focus on being the best version of that so it will in turn translate to making you more profitable. If you are a comedian you aren't going to try and sing are you? If you mow lawns and your boss recognizes you are the best edging then you won't try to plant flowers would you? Don't misunderstand as I'm not saying don't try new things. My focus is to master what you are already good at and and make yourself indispensable.</span><br></div><div><br></div><div>This starts with you, you have to have the mindset that you want better for your brand. Start your day in a positive mindset. Don't be that I hate Monday person. Look at Monday and each day as a new start and a way to make something happen. 
</div><div><br></div><div>Which person are you? Do you have an employee you keep who does substandard work because you don't want to do their job? Are you afraid to leave a job because they don't bother you and let you do what you want or it works for your schedule? A common phrase I have heard throughout my career is "this is good enough for me". Is it good enough for your spouse? Is it good enough for your children? Your future? If you aren't uncomfortable or willing to be uncomfortable then you aren't maximizing your potential and ability to grow. Believe in your brand and what you are capable of and go get what is yours.
